# Here is how to use the Bash Script that I wrote.

1. Enter in **ONE** item at a time. You can enter in **FIVE** items only.

2. After you enter in your five items, you will be asked if you want to view your list.
	- If you would like to view your list, **press 1.**
	- If you would not like to view your list, **press 0.**

3. You will then be instructed to enter in the amount your items altogether cost.
	- If the price is over $10, you will receive a message saying that it is too much money and that you are broke.

	- If the price is exactly $10, you will receive a message asking you to reevaluate if you need all those items or not.

	- If the price is less than $10, you will receive a message telling you to watch your spending.

**ENJOY USING THIS PROGRAM, IT IS VERY USEFUL FOR A BROKE COLLEGE STUDENT**
